# Broker origin TLS (end-to-end HTTPS for the CloudFront front)

The broker runs plaintext HTTP on `:8080`. Fronts terminate client TLS at the
edge, but the **edge → origin** leg was HTTP. On the AWS CloudFront front
(distribution `E2PLKW8FO3JZSA`, `d2r7mdpyevvs1m.cloudfront.net`) that leg
carried the high-value **Foundation registration token** (`Authorization`
header on `POST /api/v1/volunteers/register`) in cleartext across the public
internet. This runbook closes that leg with a TLS-terminating reverse proxy on
the broker box so the token is encrypted **relay → CloudFront edge → origin**.

```
relay ──HTTPS──► CloudFront edge ──HTTPS(:443)──► Caddy ──HTTP(127.0.0.1:8080)──► broker
                 (E2PLKW8FO3JZSA)   broker-origin.openrung.org      (container, unchanged)
```

The broker container is **not touched** — the proxy is purely additive, and the
plaintext `:8080` path stays open for community volunteer relays and for the
Cloudflare Worker front. Set up 2026-07-13.

## What must not be undone

- **`broker-origin.openrung.org` must stay DNS-only (grey cloud) in Cloudflare.**
  It is an `A` record → `54.238.185.205`. Orange-clouding (proxying) it would
  reintroduce Cloudflare's datacenter challenge on the origin and loop the
  Cloudflare Worker's subrequest back into the edge. Both CDN fronts depend on
  this record resolving straight to the broker IP.
- **Keep `:8080` open.** Community volunteers (Hetzner + Lightsail, see
  `deploy/volunteer/hetzner-up.sh`) register directly against
  `http://54.238.185.205:8080`, and the Cloudflare Worker front fetches the
  origin on `:8080`. Do not firewall it off as part of this change.
- **The origin cert must be RSA, not ECDSA** — see the CloudFront gotchas below.
- **The CloudFront behavior must use `Managed-AllViewerExceptHostHeader`, not
  `Managed-AllViewer`** — see the CloudFront gotchas below.
- Do not disable/mask the `caddy` service; it both serves TLS and auto-renews
  the cert.

## Broker box: Caddy TLS terminator

Host: Lightsail `typhoon-broker`, `ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_openrung ubuntu@54.238.185.205`.

Caddy was chosen for native Let's Encrypt auto-renewal (no cron/certbot timer to
manage). ACM certs cannot be installed on Lightsail, and a self-signed cert
would not validate at CloudFront — so a publicly-trusted Let's Encrypt cert is
required.

### Install

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https curl gnupg
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' \
  | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y caddy   # installs the systemd service, enabled
```

### Config

`/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` (also committed as `deploy/broker/Caddyfile` for
reference):

```caddyfile
{
	key_type rsa2048        # REQUIRED for CloudFront — see gotchas
}

broker-origin.openrung.org {
	reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080 {
		header_up -CF-Connecting-IP
		header_up X-Forwarded-For {remote_host}
	}
	log {
		output file /var/log/caddy/broker-origin.access.log {
			roll_size 20MiB
			roll_keep 5
		}
		format json
	}
}
```

The log directory is provided by a systemd drop-in (the packaged unit sandboxes
the service, so a plain `mkdir` is not enough — systemd must own the path):

`/etc/systemd/system/caddy.service.d/logdir.conf`

```ini
[Service]
LogsDirectory=caddy
LogsDirectoryMode=0750
```

Apply changes as the `caddy` user (never `sudo caddy validate`/`fmt` as root — it
creates a root-owned log file that the service then can't open):

```sh
sudo -u caddy caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile --adapter caddyfile
sudo systemctl reload caddy
```

### Firewall

`:443` was opened on the Lightsail instance (additive; `:80` was already open and
is used for the ACME HTTP-01 challenge):

```sh
aws lightsail open-instance-public-ports --instance-name typhoon-broker \
  --region ap-northeast-1 --port-info fromPort=443,toPort=443,protocol=TCP
```

Open ports afterward: `22, 80, 443, 8080`.

### Cert + renewal

- Cert: `CN=broker-origin.openrung.org`, **RSA-2048**, Let's Encrypt, 90-day.
  Issued via **HTTP-01** on `:80`.
- Renewal: **automatic and native to Caddy** (ARI-scheduled; renews well before
  expiry as long as the service runs). No timer or cron to maintain. Stored in
  `/var/lib/caddy/.local/share/caddy/`.
- No ACME account email is set (Caddy auto-renews, so expiry notices are
  unnecessary, and it avoids attaching an operator identity to issuance).

## CloudFront front: `E2PLKW8FO3JZSA`

Two config changes (CloudFront/ACM are global — use `--region us-east-1`; the
CLI profile's default region is a broken AZ value so pass it explicitly):

1. **Origin protocol `http-only` → `https-only`** (`HTTPSPort` was already 443,
   `OriginSslProtocols=[TLSv1.2]`). This is the change that encrypts the leg.
2. **Origin request policy `Managed-AllViewer` → `Managed-AllViewerExceptHostHeader`**
   (`216adef6-…` → `b689b0a8-53d0-40ab-baf2-68738e2966ac`). **Required** — see
   gotchas. This policy still forwards everything except `Host` (all other
   headers incl. `Authorization`, all cookies, all query strings), so the
   Foundation token still reaches the origin.

Both are applied with `get-distribution-config` → edit `DistributionConfig` →
`update-distribution --if-match <ETag>`, then `aws cloudfront wait
distribution-deployed`.

### Two CloudFront gotchas (each caused a 502 during rollout)

1. **RSA cert, not ECDSA.** Caddy's default leaf key is ECDSA (P-256).
   CloudFront's origin-facing TLS cipher list is **RSA-only** (it offers the
   origin `ECDHE-RSA-*` / `AES*` suites and *no* `ECDHE-ECDSA-*` suites), so an
   ECDSA leaf shares no cipher with CloudFront and the handshake fails with a
   502. Fixed with `key_type rsa2048`. (Changing `key_type` does not re-issue an
   existing cert — the old ECDSA cert dir under
   `…/certificates/…/broker-origin.openrung.org/` was removed and Caddy
   restarted to force fresh RSA issuance.)

2. **`AllViewerExceptHostHeader`, not `AllViewer`.** With `Managed-AllViewer`,
   CloudFront forwards the viewer `Host` header **and uses it as the origin
   SNI** — so it sent `SNI: d2r7mdpyevvs1m.cloudfront.net`. Caddy has no cert for
   that name and rejected the handshake (`no certificate available for
   'd2r7mdpyevvs1m.cloudfront.net'`) → 502. `AllViewerExceptHostHeader` makes
   CloudFront send the **origin** hostname (`broker-origin.openrung.org`) as both
   `Host` and SNI, which Caddy serves and routes. CloudFront still validates the
   returned cert against the *origin domain name*, which matches.

## Verify

```sh
# Origin TLS directly (publicly-trusted cert, signed relay list):
curl -v https://broker-origin.openrung.org/api/v1/relays        # 200, cert verifies

# End-to-end through CloudFront (works from a datacenter IP; the Cloudflare
# Worker front 403s datacenter IPs by design):
curl https://d2r7mdpyevvs1m.cloudfront.net/api/v1/relays?limit=1 # 200, X-OpenRung-Relays-Signature present
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}' \
  https://d2r7mdpyevvs1m.cloudfront.net/api/v1/volunteers/register   # 400 {"error":"public_host is required"}

# Volunteer plaintext path still intact:
curl http://54.238.185.205:8080/api/v1/relays                   # 200

# Confirm CloudFront connects over TLS (SNI = origin, not the CF domain):
sudo tail /var/log/caddy/broker-origin.access.log   # request.tls.server_name = broker-origin.openrung.org
```

## Rollback

The proxy is additive and reversible. To revert the CloudFront front to the
previous (verified-working) plaintext-origin state, restore the original
`DistributionConfig` (`OriginProtocolPolicy=http-only` +
`OriginRequestPolicyId=Managed-AllViewer`):

```sh
aws cloudfront get-distribution-config --id E2PLKW8FO3JZSA --region us-east-1   # note ETag
# set OriginProtocolPolicy=http-only and OriginRequestPolicyId=216adef6-5c7f-47e4-b989-5492eafa07d3
aws cloudfront update-distribution --id E2PLKW8FO3JZSA --region us-east-1 \
  --distribution-config file://rollback.json --if-match <ETag>
```

Caddy itself can be stopped without affecting the broker or `:8080`
(`sudo systemctl stop caddy`) — only the origin `:443` and the CloudFront front
depend on it.

## Known follow-ups (not done here)

- **Per-client rate-limit / telemetry granularity on the CloudFront path.** The
  broker trusts only Cloudflare ranges for forwarded client IPs
  (`internal/broker/clientip.go`); it does **not** trust the new loopback hop, so
  it records `127.0.0.1` as the client for CloudFront-fronted requests — i.e.
  the whole CloudFront front shares one relay-list rate-limit bucket (2 req/s,
  burst 30) and one telemetry client IP. This is benign day-to-day (CloudFront
  is a cold 2.5 s-stagger *failover* front — normal traffic ≈ 0), but a
  mass-failover surge (primary Worker/Cloudflare down) would all land in that one
  bucket. To restore per-edge-IP bucketing, recreate the broker container with
  `OPENRUNG_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS=127.0.0.1/32,::1/128`; the Caddy config already
  forwards the unspoofable CloudFront edge IP as the sole `X-Forwarded-For` value
  (and strips client-supplied `CF-Connecting-IP`/`XFF`), so no proxy change is
  needed — only the broker env. **Requires a broker container recreate → operator
  approval** (per the no-autonomous-broker-recreate policy).
- **Cloudflare Worker front origin leg is still plaintext.**
  `broker.openrung.org` (the Worker) still fetches `http://broker-origin…:8080`.
  Now that `:443` origin TLS exists, the Worker could be pointed at
  `https://broker-origin.openrung.org` to close its leg too — a separate change
  to the higher-traffic primary front, deliberately out of scope here.
